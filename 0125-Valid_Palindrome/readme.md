# 125. Valid Palindrome

## 🟢 Difficulty: Easy

### 📘 Problem Statement

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward.

Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

## 🖼️ Example 1

**Input**

s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"


**Output**

true


**Explanation**

"amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.


---

## 🖼️ Example 2

**Input**

s = "race a car"


**Output**

false


**Explanation**

"raceacar" is not a palindrome.


---

## 🖼️ Example 3

**Input**

s = " "


**Output**

true


**Explanation**
After removing non-alphanumeric characters, the string becomes empty `""`.
An empty string is considered a palindrome.

---

## 🔒 Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.

---

## 💡 Approach — Two Pointer Method

We use two pointers:

- `left` starting from the beginning
- `right` starting from the end

### 🔹 Algorithm

1. Initialize `left = 0`, `right = s.length() - 1`
2. While `left < right`
   - Skip non-alphanumeric characters
   - Convert both characters to lowercase
   - If they are not equal → return `false`
   - Move both pointers inward
3. If loop completes → return `true`
